# Workshop prerequisites

Are you going to participate in an Arvest workshop? To make the most of our time together, please take a few moments to go through these steps to see how you can prepare before you arrive. Note that **none of these steps are obligatory**, but they can make things go a bit faster on the day or help set you up for the future.

## 1. 💻 Create an Arvest account

You will be given a test account during the workshop, however you can also create your own account if you wish! To do this, follow these steps:

- Head over to [https://arvest.app/](https://arvest.app/).
- Click `Connect` in the top-right corner of the screen.
- Click `Create Account`.
- Provide a valid email, a unique username and password and click `Submit`.
- You will recieve an email asking you to confirm your email. Click on the url provided.
- You will need to accept the terms of use on the page you will be sent to.

You're all set! If you have any problems, please let us know - you can contact us via [contact@arvest.app](mailto:contact@arvest.app).

## 2. 🎞️ Create a peertube account

Again, this is optional, however if you would like to use your own video sources you have two options: either upload media to [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/), or you can create an account on our instance of [peertube](https://peertube.arvest.app/) - an open source alternative to Youtube (**recommended**). To save time, you can create your peertube account ahead of the workshop by following these steps:

- Head over to [https://peertube.arvest.app/](https://peertube.arvest.app/)
- Click `Request an account` in the top left of the screen.
- Create your account and wait for us to validate your account (this shouldn't take more than 24 hours).

## 3. 🔍 Create a google account

During the workshop, we shall be running a python notebook using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). You can just watch this, but if you want to run the code on your machine you'll need to create a google account if you don't already have one, and activate Colab.

## 4. 📼 Watch the quickstart video

If you wish, you can watch the ten minute quickstart guide video [here](https://youtu.be/zQOm8V22wI4?si=BOGUbh_MsPShksoV). Everything covered in the video will also be covered in the workshop, but it can't hurt to go over things twice!

## 5. 🗂️ Prepare some media

During the workshop we will provide you with some example media to have a play with, however if you wish to use your own media that's also great! To make things fluid, try and upload you media to the web ahead of the workshop, especially large audiovisual files.

- You can upload **images** directly to your Arvest accoutn, or find some images which are available by direct link online.
- You can upload **videos** to [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) or out instance of [peertube](https://peertube.arvest.app/) (you will need to create a peertube account for this).

## 6. 👩‍🎨 Experiment!

You are of course welcome to experiment as much as you want ahead of the workshop! You'll learn best by doing, so get stuck in! If you run into difficulties, make a note of it and we can chat it out during the workshop, or get in touch with us at [contact@arvest.app](mailto:contact@arvest.app).

**👋 See you at the workshop!**
